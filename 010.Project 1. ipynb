The rules are:\n","\n","1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say \"OUT OF BOUNDS\"\n","2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is\n"," * within 10 of the number, return \"WARM!\"\n"," * further than 10 away from the number, return \"COLD!\"\n","3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is\n"," * closer to the number than the previous guess return \"WARMER!\"\n"," * farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"COLDER!\"\n","4. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!\n","\n","You can try this from scratch, or follow the steps outlined below. A separate Solution notebook has been provided.
