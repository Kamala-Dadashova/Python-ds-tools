Generators allow us to generate as we go along, instead of holding everything in memory.\n","\n","We've touched on this topic in the past when discussing certain built-in Python functions like range(), map() and filter().\n","\n","Let's explore a little deeper. We've learned how to create functions with def and the return statement. Generator functions allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off. This type of function is a generator in Python, allowing us to generate a sequence of values over time. The main difference in syntax will be the use of a yield statement.\n","\n","In most aspects, a generator function will appear very similar to a normal function. The main difference is when a generator function is compiled they become an object that supports an iteration protocol. That means when they are called in your code they don't actually return a value and then exit. Instead, generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation. The main advantage here is that instead of having to compute an entire series of values up front, the generator computes one value and then suspends its activity awaiting the next instruction. This feature is known as state suspension.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"reaojWwkRBrv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Previously\n","def simple(n):\n","  result=[]\n","  for num in range(n):\n","    result.append(num**3)\n","  return result"],"metadata":{"id":"aGFnJDhEbykf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713548333670,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":185,"user":{"displayName":"Kamala Dadashova","userId":"15370175733159332250"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["simple(10)#takes a lot of memeory"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8oIllLw1cJ43","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713548346118,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Kamala Dadashova","userId":"15370175733159332250"}},"outputId":"0637ff2f-3db7-44b0-cb0f-2e49f4046429"},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Generator function for the cube of numbers (power of 3)\n","def gencubes(n):\n","    for num in range(n):\n","        yield num**3"],"metadata":{"id":"YAgubLp6SrqT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713545869734,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Kamala Dadashova","userId":"15370175733159332250"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for x in gencubes(10):\n","    print(x)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Qwbpz8A9SuU0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713545873650,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":183,"user":{"displayName":"Kamala Dadashova","userId":"15370175733159332250"}},"outputId":"1481d09b-4f99-4b69-8c65-f44a9cdf6643"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0\n","1\n","8\n","27\n","64\n","125\n","216\n","343\n","512\n","729\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["list(gencubes(3))#if you want you can still do list"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"u82ijafHcTjV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713548394054,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":154,"user":{"displayName":"Kamala Dadashova","userId":"15370175733159332250"}},"outputId":"0b68329a-8d7c-4d1f-dbf4-1c21ccda2620"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[0, 1, 8]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Great!
